# CyberSentry Series

Welcome to the CyberSentry Series â€“ a comprehensive suite of tools designed for proactive cybersecurity analysts and IT professionals. This suite includes four specialized tools that work in synergy to provide an all-encompassing approach to cyber threat identification, analysis, and network reconnaissance.

## Tools in the Series

### CVE Lookup

**CVE Lookup** is a quick and efficient tool for cybersecurity professionals to access the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. It allows users to search for known vulnerabilities in systems and software, providing essential information needed for risk assessment and mitigation.

### CPE Lookup

**CPE Lookup** aids in the identification of Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) entries, enabling users to enumerate and categorize a vast array of devices and software within a network. It is crucial for understanding the landscape of platforms that may be susceptible to specific vulnerabilities.

### Bewear

**Bewear - Break Everything With Enumeration And Reconnaissance** is a robust tool that employs aggressive tactics to unearth potential security weaknesses. By simulating an attack through enumeration and reconnaissance, Bewear helps in identifying what an attacker would target and exploit.

### Go Get Galaxy
